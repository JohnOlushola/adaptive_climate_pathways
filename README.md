# Directed Chaos Approach for Climate Change Mitigation

This repository introduces a novel approach aimed at establishing effective pathways to prevent irreversible climate change. Leveraging the widely recognized logistic map, the system is directed through growth, decay, stable, or chaotic regimes to generate unique pathways, hence the term "Directed Chaos."

## Usage
The provided notebook encapsulates all the logic necessary for implementing this approach. To replicate the results, simply execute the Run All command.
